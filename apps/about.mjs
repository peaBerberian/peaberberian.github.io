	<p>Hi, my name is Paul Berberian, I'm 34¬π I'm a software engineer and tech lead at Canal+ Group living in Montpellier, France.

	<p>I'm mostly working on media web-applications using TypeScript, JavaScript, Zig and Rust (thanks to WebAssembly).<br>Right now the main project I lead is the RxPlayer, at Canal+ Group.<\p><p>The RxPlayer is a library allowing various front-end applications - among which Canal+' flagship products - to play live and VoD contents with adaptive streaming, multiple tracks and DRMs. It targets both the web and embedded platforms (set-top boxes, SmartTVs, ChromeCast, game consoles etc.).</p>

	<p>I also lead several other projects: some allowing media playback under more locked vendor-specific media APIs, but also debugging and reverse engineering tools helping front-end developpers to maintain those applications.<br>A part of the projects I maintain at Canal+ are <a href="https://github.com/canalplus/" target="_blank">open-source</a>¬π.<br>I also maintain many <a href="https://github.com/peaberberian/" target="_blank">personal projects</a>.</p>

	<p class="asterisk"><span class="note">1</a>. Most projects at Canal+ are closed-source, including some that I lead. The few maintained open-sourced ones (that are under the <i>"canalplus"</i> organization on GitHub) all gravitate around the RxPlayer library and are all under my lead.</span></p>

	<div class=\"separator\"></div>

	<p>Previously, I worked on set-top boxes, to create large front-end applications with important stability constraints and many features not usually found in web platforms.<br/>Among them: updates, storage management, browsing in offline contexts, records scheduling, TV remote-based navigation, multi-devices support, media player integration and TV channel scanning.</p>
