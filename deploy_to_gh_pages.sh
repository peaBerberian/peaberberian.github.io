# Update gh-pages
# ===============
#
# This script allows to automatically update the desktop on the gh-pages
# branch.
#
# To use it:
#
#   1. Be sure that you're on a clean (no staged files and no diff) branch.
#
#   2. Call this script.
#      Some user interactions will be needed to avoid doing unwanted commits.
#
#   3. That's it!
#      A commit should have been pushed to the gh-pages.
