<!--
This is the HTML page that is loaded for "sandboxed" apps, which are apps completely
isolated from the desktop: they don't have any access to its data and they run
parallely with it.

This is done as a security and isolation (storage API isolation, memory isolation,
logic pallalelism) mechanism.

A postMessage-based API is provided to those apps to allow interaction with the
desktop (e.g. file opening/saving capabilities), but all those operations are
tightly controlled by the desktop.
