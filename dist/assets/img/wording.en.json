    "title": "What I've worked on",
    "shortDescription": "I've been mostly working on media web-applications using TypeScript, JavaScript and Rust (thanks to WebAssembly).",
    "descriptionSTB": "I began working on set-top boxes, to create large front-end applications with important stability constraints and many features not usually found in web platforms.<br/>Among them: updates, storage management, browsing in offline contexts, records scheduling, TV remote-based navigation, multi-devices support, media player integration and TV channel scanning.",
    "descriptionPlayer": "After multiple years working on this subject, I focused on a core part: media playback.<br/>The main project I'm leading now is the <a href=\"https://github.com/canalplus/rx-player\">RxPlayer</a>, an open-source media player library which targets both the web and embedded platforms (set-top boxes, SmartTVs, ChromeCast, game consoles etc.).<br/>I also lead several other projects: some allowing media playback under more locked vendor-specific media APIs, but also debugging and reverse engineering tools helping front-end developpers (including I!) to maintain those applications."

    "title": "What I like to work on",
    "descriptionWork": "<p>I've been generally interested by the more technical aspects of web applications.<br /></p><p>On that matter, the RxPlayer, my main project, is a good example.</br>Despite running in a browser, it has unusual features for a web application: it spawns a separate thread to run its main logic (so heavy media playback logic is never blocking the UI and vice-versa), it has its fair share of parsing logic for both binary and textual formats (it even has a parser relying on WebAssembly due to performance and memory constraints), tricks to support devices with restricted resources and an advanced request scheduling logic.<p>Moreover, a complex media player projects allows to provide a quasi-endless stream of possible improvements - which is very satisfying for the team I lead.</p>",
    "descriptionPersonal": "<p>I also like developing with Rust and lately Zig on some personal projects.</p><p>I'm notably looking forward and excited for possible synergies between using high-level and flexible languages like JavaScript and TypeScript for the main chunk of an application (or at least web-applications) and using lower-level languages for logic with higher performance or even memory constraints.</p>"
