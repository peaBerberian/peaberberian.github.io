<p>"EME" for "Encrypted Media Extensions" is a group of web API to allow the playback of encrypted media in a browser, without having to resort in an easily-breakable decryption step in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Media encryption is often a requirement of content right-holders and as such almost all big streaming platforms (Netflix, Disney+, Canal+, Amazon Prime Video etc.) rely on those API to have the right to distribute those contents to their customers inside a web browser.</p>
<p>In some contexts EME API even allow the communication with secure hardware enclaves inside the user's CPU (e.g. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment" target="_blank">TEE</a>) or GPU so that both media decryption and decoding never leave the hardware (again, to ensure that the decrypted content is not easily accessible).<br>As a surprising anecdote, in that situation no software is able to "see" the decoded media, for example even screen recorders and screenshoting softwares will usually show a black screen where the media should have been.</p>`,e}},{text:"Why creating this tool?",icon:"\u{1F6E0}\uFE0F",centered:!0,render:()=>{let e=document.createElement("div");e.appendChild(a("What's the role of this tool?",{}));let t=document.createElement("div");return e.appendChild(t),t.innerHTML=`<p>The EME API are flexible and allow to configure complex behaviors to allow for optimizations and future-proofing some future security requirements. Due to their complexity, they <b>very often</b> are subtly broken, and all media players relying on those API end up writing a lot of platform-specific (e.g. edge-only, Samsung TV-only etc.) work-arounds.</p>
<p>Which brings us to why I needed to create this tool.<br>It works by identifying and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch" target="_blank">monkey-patching</a> all EME API, then filling an array with details about those calls. By then manually inspecting that array, we're able to understand what was done - like what API was called with which arguments and in which order.</p>
<p>This in turn is used to know what can be done and what behavior is problematic on a given user-agent and platform.</p>`,e}}]}}export{o as create};
